# DeepFake Detection
 Spectrogram analysis helps detect deepfakes by visualizing frequency anomalies in audio and video signals. It can be used with machine learning models to identify synthetic patterns that are not naturally occurring. Ongoing research focuses on improving detection accuracy and efficiency, especially against evolving deepfake techniques.
