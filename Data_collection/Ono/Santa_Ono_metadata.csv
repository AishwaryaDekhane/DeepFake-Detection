Santa_Ono_1.wav," Hello colleagues and friends across the UM community. Shortly after starting my dream job, President of this exceptional university, I asked us to engage in a strategic vision."
Santa_Ono_2.wav," process. One that would sharpen our impact and determine where we will go and what we will dare to achieve. More than 25,000 students,"
Santa_Ono_3.wav," faculty, staff, alumni, donors, and members of our local community have engaged in the visioning process. I am so grateful to all of you who joined us."
Santa_Ono_4.wav," For together, we have created a new vision that will open new horizons and new opportunities while drawing on our ethos, our tremendous strengths."
Santa_Ono_5.wav, and our exceptional capabilities as a university. Together we will transform the University of Michigan into the defining public university. Boldly
Santa_Ono_6.wav, exemplified by our innovation and service to the public good. And together we will leverage our interdisciplinary and excellence at scale to end.
Santa_Ono_7.wav," educate learners, advance society, and make groundbreaking discoveries to impact the greatest challenges facing humanity. Over the next 10 years,"
Santa_Ono_8.wav," We will harness our unparalleled excellence and vast intellectual resources to make dramatic, focused, and demonstrable advancements."
Santa_Ono_9.wav," in service to humanity. We will do so in several impact areas, including life changing education, human health and"
Santa_Ono_10.wav," well-being, climate action, sustainability and environmental justice, and democracy, civic and global engagement."
Santa_Ono_11.wav," as we advance in these areas and to truly realize our vision as the defining public university, we will make strategic investments in core"
Santa_Ono_12.wav, commitments and key institutional priorities. These are designed to advance our mission and to boldly affirm the critical role of higher education.
Santa_Ono_13.wav, education in society for generations to come. They include essential areas of growth and engagement including a priority.
Santa_Ono_14.wav," purpose, driving education and student experience. Research, discovery, scholarship, and artificial intelligence. Community Health Center"
Santa_Ono_15.wav," support, prevention and performance, arts and creative expression, diversity, equity and inclusion."
Santa_Ono_16.wav," faculty and staff engagement and experience, and innovation, partnerships, and economic developments. In concert we'll come our campers."
Santa_Ono_17.wav," Campus Plan 2050, through which we will make the vision into a reality for our Ann Arbor campus. All of these efforts and"
Santa_Ono_18.wav," more will be guided by our commitment to our core values as a university. Values of respect and diversity, inclusion, and"
Santa_Ono_19.wav," and equity, innovation and integrity. That brings us to this month's portrait of a Wolverine. It's a portrait that involves all of us."
Santa_Ono_20.wav, us. All of you who have created this vision and all of you who transform it into a reality. For it is now ours to
Santa_Ono_21.wav, build and create to aspire and to achieve to serve and to lead. So this month's portrait of a Wolverine
Santa_Ono_22.wav," belongs to all of us. To all of those who guided by our ethos and our vision will create a stronger, brighter,"
Santa_Ono_23.wav, bolder university. We've established our vision. Let's make it a reality. Wherever we go progress follows.
Santa_Ono_24.wav," University of Michigan community. Even in the season of celebrations and light, our hearts remain broken by the terrible bloodshed in the Middle East. And the"
Santa_Ono_25.wav," loss of so many innocent lives. For Angaza and the West Bank, violence is escalating. Bombs are falling."
Santa_Ono_26.wav," flames are raging. Palestinians, civilians are suffering and dying and mourning the loss of those closest to them. In Israel, families, and families are suffering."
Santa_Ono_27.wav, families continue to weep for the loss of their loved ones on October 7th. Even as so many continue to hope against heart-wrenching hope that those who
Santa_Ono_28.wav," those taken hostage by Hamas will be safely returned. I recognize how grief's stricken, how heartbroken, how"
Santa_Ono_29.wav," in rage so many in our community feel. For this tempest of war has placed a terrible burden on our students, our faculty, our students."
Santa_Ono_30.wav," staff from our Israeli, Palestinian, Muslim, Jewish, and Arab communities. Deeply rooted bigotry."
Santa_Ono_31.wav, have produced poisonous fruit. Students have faced intimidation. Faculty members have suffered verbal abuse. And so
Santa_Ono_32.wav, sadly at times stereotypes have spoken far louder than truths. I also recognize that the pre-dreamer of the past is a true reality.
Santa_Ono_33.wav, your statements of mine did not fully express our heartbreak for the suffering of the innocent people in the Arab and Muslim communities. Or are our
Santa_Ono_34.wav," front at the vandalism of the flyers and posters, which affected Jewish students, Palestinian students, and many other communities."
Santa_Ono_35.wav," we will, I will do better in the future. Yet no words of mine, no matter how heartfelt and no statement,"
Santa_Ono_36.wav, of mind no matter how clear will assuage the heartbreak or bring this terrible war to a close. So what is our role as a
Santa_Ono_37.wav, a great pluralistic public university. I respectfully offer that we must reaffirm our values. We must show others that
Santa_Ono_38.wav, there can be and must be a better way. We must show the world that here at the University of Michigan we can consider issues of great contention
Santa_Ono_39.wav," with respect, inclusion and integrity. We must make it clear that racism, anti-Semitism and anti-Arab and anti-Memory"
Santa_Ono_40.wav, Muslim bigotry have no place on our campus or in our community. They demean our values. They debase our university.
Santa_Ono_41.wav," they disrespect all religions and cultures. Even more, we must not permit vigilante tactics."
Santa_Ono_42.wav," Whether they be vandalized flyers, doxing trucks, or uncomfortable caricatures or comparisons to impede our commitment"
Santa_Ono_43.wav," to the freedom of speech, inquiry and debate, and our dedication to inclusion, pluralism, and unity. Rather,"
Santa_Ono_44.wav," we must reaffirm our commitment to our values of respect and inclusion, equity and diversity. Especially when passions are aroused,"
Santa_Ono_45.wav," we must recommit to heating the quiet call of civic engagement and citizenship. To listening with empathy, to walking together in humility,"
Santa_Ono_46.wav, and to treating each person with deep respect and dignity. I am convinced that we can lead with our example.
Santa_Ono_47.wav," we can show a better way. So during these dark days of violence, let us renew our commitment to respecting one another."
Santa_Ono_48.wav, to reaching across our communities and to creating a campus where all people's of all backgrounds and faiths can join together in creating a bridge.
Santa_Ono_49.wav," Hello colleagues and friends across the University of Michigan community. Spring is a season of new beginnings, and one of the new beginnings for Montaulgence and Generative AI."
Santa_Ono_50.wav," brightest days for the University of Michigan lie ahead. By constantly discovering, learning, connecting, aspiring,"
Santa_Ono_51.wav," we can transform. This is our time to renew this rise, this commitment. This is our moment to dream, bold dreams."
Santa_Ono_52.wav, Let us come together like never before. Live our best traditions as a university and create a future beyond our dreams.
Santa_Ono_53.wav," everyone, it's wonderful to be here in this absolutely stunning Hill Auditorium. Paul, all of the reasons. Thank you so much."
Santa_Ono_54.wav," this high honor to serve the greatest university in the world, the University of Michigan."
Santa_Ono_55.wav, Thank you all for joining us whether online or in this magnificent auditorium. Thank you again.
Santa_Ono_56.wav, of you for this opportunity and for your faith in me. It is a singular honor and privilege to be inaugurated today.
Santa_Ono_57.wav, to serve as the University of Michigan's 15th President. I would also like to thank our distinguished guests and speakers for joining us.
Santa_Ono_58.wav," us. You've had a chance to hear from them. They're remarkable people. Michigan's Lieutenant Governor, Garland Gilchrist, an engineer"
Santa_Ono_59.wav, by training in a problem solver by vocation. But a proud Miss Uganda and a proud Wolverine. Let's hear it for him.
Santa_Ono_60.wav, And you heard from Victor Zau.
Santa_Ono_61.wav, He's an iconic figure in medicine and in science. He's a leader who serves as a president of the National Academy of Sciences.
Santa_Ono_62.wav, Academy of Medicine of the United States of America. I've been lucky to come to know Victor over the past 15 years.
Santa_Ono_63.wav," I've looked up to every step of the way. As you know, we were both educated at McGill University in Montreal."
Santa_Ono_64.wav," And we both worked at Harvard. And I looked up to them, as I said, as a great scientist, a great healer."
Santa_Ono_65.wav," someone who knows how to build institutions. Victor, thank you so much for being here today."
Santa_Ono_66.wav," And of course Hannah Holburn Gray, a trailblazer."
Santa_Ono_67.wav," a great academic. Someone whose advice and counsel is thought, sought after all around the world, President Emerita."
Santa_Ono_68.wav," of the University of Chicago, an exceptional president, and a truly inspiring model of leadership, as you heard,"
Santa_Ono_69.wav," Hanna signed my undergraduate degree from the University of Chicago in 1984. Thank you, Hanna, for being here."
Santa_Ono_70.wav," And Alan Liu, Professor Alan Liu."
Santa_Ono_71.wav," even more important than being the chair of the Senate Advisory Committee on University Affairs. Alan is a fellow Vancouverite, a Canadian."
Santa_Ono_72.wav," And he earned his undergraduate degree from none other than the University of British Columbia. And for all of you watching from UBC,"
Santa_Ono_73.wav, Thank you for a remarkable almost seven years serving as your president. What a wonderful institution I shall always be proud.
Santa_Ono_74.wav, to have been associated with UBC. Let's hear it for UBC. Applause and answers.
Santa_Ono_75.wav," And what can I say about my mentor, Earl Lewis, someone who is known throughout this campus, but also"
Santa_Ono_76.wav," around the world, my mentor and my guide, and one of the most outstanding people I know on this planet."
Santa_Ono_77.wav, him. He gave me the high gift of trust at Emory University and as you heard he created an office around me. I was the first ever
Santa_Ono_78.wav," Senior Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education. And in doing so, he launched my career in administration. I continue to work with him."
Santa_Ono_79.wav," to rely on his wisdom and counsel today, I would not be here, or at not for Earl, and therefore I would not be here."
Santa_Ono_80.wav, We're at not for the University of Michigan. Let's hear it for Earl. powered.
Santa_Ono_81.wav, Now you've had a chance to hear from my partner in academic leadership. Those of you who know how universities
Santa_Ono_82.wav," run, know that every President needs a great provost. And we have one here in Provost Laurie McColley."
Santa_Ono_83.wav, I am so grateful for even the
Santa_Ono_84.wav," the past only four and a half months of what is clear about who she is to the core, her selfless service."
Santa_Ono_85.wav," dedication to this university, her steadfast, calm, collected, inspired strategic leadership."
Santa_Ono_86.wav, And I'm so glad that we will be serving the University of Michigan together for many years to come. This is a time for us to all work together.
Santa_Ono_87.wav, for stability and for bold steps forward. Both of us benefit from our immediate predecessor.
Santa_Ono_88.wav," who is on the platform party. President Marita Mary Sue Coleman, let's hear it for her. Applause"
Santa_Ono_89.wav, I can't find the way.
Santa_Ono_90.wav," words to express my really are gratitude to Mary Sue, 12 years of service."
Santa_Ono_91.wav, to this institution and she came back and she handed the baton to me. I couldn't think of a better guy.
Santa_Ono_92.wav," for a university president. This my dream job, as she is perhaps one of the greatest university presidents"
Santa_Ono_93.wav," of any institution of our time. I also want to acknowledge the members of our leadership team, including our chancellors."
Santa_Ono_94.wav, our Vice Presidents and our Deans. That's here for that.
Santa_Ono_95.wav, the deans. You know I said to the deans.
Santa_Ono_96.wav," You're going to see a lot more of me than a typical president. You agree that's the case, right? We travel together to California. We get together to talk about"
Santa_Ono_97.wav, the importance of research. We talked about how to bring faculty and students together to solve the most vexing problems in the world like climate change.
Santa_Ono_98.wav," It's a privilege. This group of deans is simply outstanding. I've been impressed with your dedication, your ability, and I'm so"
Santa_Ono_99.wav," grateful to all of you. And I'm also glad to welcome members of our staff, our faculty, from not only in Arbor, but Flin and DiRber. Let's hear from you."
Santa_Ono_100.wav, for our staff and faculty. Come to our office. Thank you for listening to us today.
Santa_Ono_101.wav," You see, before I came here, some of you may know that the University of Michigan is considered to be a spawning ground for talent."
Santa_Ono_102.wav," where you look, whether you're looking the Ivy League or the Big Ten or even the SEC, you will see people that were trained at the University of Michigan. I couldn't"
Santa_Ono_103.wav, not imagine serving with a more committed and outstanding and talented team. Let's hear it for them once again.
Santa_Ono_104.wav," But first and foremost, I met some of you out there."
Santa_Ono_105.wav," to thank our students. Those of you who have joined us, it is because of you, it is your energy, your passion, your intellect and confidence that will see"
Santa_Ono_106.wav, this institution and this nation in this world to better days ahead. Let's hear it for our students.
Santa_Ono_107.wav," Finally, I want to say something about my"
Santa_Ono_108.wav, family whose love and support of me over my lifetime has been foundational to anything that I have achieved.
Santa_Ono_109.wav," Some of you know that my parents, Takashi and Sachiko, immigrated from Japan shortly after the summer."
Santa_Ono_110.wav," Second World War, and a penny to their name, all their belongings in a single suitcase. My father taught us."
Santa_Ono_111.wav," She was a freshly minted PhD graduate, graduating from Tokyo University, and then receiving his PhD from Nagoya University."
Santa_Ono_112.wav," And he had been invited by a renowned mathematician Andre Valle, and the then director of the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study, Robert H."
Santa_Ono_113.wav, Oppenheimer to be among a select group of talented young mathematicians from Japan to be invited to be among the talented young mathematicians from Japan to be among the talented young mathematicians from Japan to be among the talented young mathematicians from Japan to be among the talented young mathematicians from Japan to be among the talented young mathematicians from Japan to be among the talented young mathematicians from Japan to be among the talented young mathematicians from Japan to be among the talented young mathematicians from Japan to be among the talented young mathematicians from Japan to be among the talented young mathematicians from Japan to be among the talented young mathematicians from Japan to be among the talented young mathematicians from Japan to be among the talented young mathematicians from Japan to be among the talented young mathematicians from Japan to be among the talented young mathematicians from Japan to be among the talented young mathematicians from Japan to be among the talented young mathematicians from Japan to be among the talented young mathematicians from Japan to be among the talented young mathematicians from Japan to be among the talented young mathematicians from Japan to be among the talented young mathematicians from Japan to be among the talented young mathematicians from Japan to be among
Santa_Ono_114.wav," visiting members of the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study, for those of you who know mathematics and physics, considered a mecca for people."
Santa_Ono_115.wav," cure mathematics and theoretical physics. My parents gave birth to my brother Memorial, who you just heard, in Tokyo, Japan."
Santa_Ono_116.wav, And I was born in Vancouver where my father was an assistant professor of mathematics.
Santa_Ono_117.wav," at the University of British Columbia. My younger brother, who's here, I think over there, over there."
Santa_Ono_118.wav, Where are you? Where? Over there. Where are you?
Santa_Ono_119.wav," Please stand up, Ken. This is my brother, Ken Ono. Thank you. Thank you."
Santa_Ono_120.wav," Ken was born in Philadelphia when my father was professor of mathematics at the University of Pennsylvania. Throughout my entire life, I was a little bit more than I thought."
Santa_Ono_121.wav," life I've been inspired by the accomplishments of my grandparents, my parents, and my brothers."
Santa_Ono_122.wav, My brother is a leading mathematician currently working in the provost office at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville.
Santa_Ono_123.wav," As you know, both Memorial and Ken are at the top of their fields in music and mathematics. Did you heard Memorial is a professor of piano at Crating the Versus?"
Santa_Ono_124.wav," and Ken is a professor of mathematics at UVA. And now my parents, although they cannot be with us today,"
Santa_Ono_125.wav," know that they're watching Be Alive Street. Thanks, mom and dad, for everything. I love you very much."
Santa_Ono_126.wav," And above everything else, I want to express my gratitude."
Santa_Ono_127.wav," to my own family. Wendy has been the rock of my life since we were married in 1989, and I'm grateful for her."
Santa_Ono_128.wav, enduring support of me. People say that being a university president is a challenging occupation.
Santa_Ono_129.wav, But anyone who has been a university president can tell you that being a partner or spouse of a university president is ten times more difficult.
Santa_Ono_130.wav, Thank you.
Santa_Ono_131.wav," And of course, I don't know where they are, but the apples of my eye, my two"
Santa_Ono_132.wav," daughters, Juliana and Sarah, who have made me so proud from the days they were born to today."
Santa_Ono_133.wav," Julianne and Sarah, where are you? Please stand up."
Santa_Ono_134.wav," So to Wendy, Juliana Sarah, my son-in-law, David."
Santa_Ono_135.wav," and our puppy Romeo. And if you know any of you know me from my Cincinnati days, I used to end graduation with a song, Lyric."
Santa_Ono_136.wav," This is going to date me, but as Debbie Boone said, you light up my life, you give me hope to carry on."
Santa_Ono_137.wav, You light up my days and fill my nights with song. Let's hear it from my family. Applause
Santa_Ono_138.wav," Now, it's with Victor and some others, and they said there are a lot of university"
Santa_Ono_139.wav," University of Chicago people here. And a number of them, I can see them right there. They're other ones. They were my classmates, and we all got our degrees"
Santa_Ono_140.wav," from Hannah Holburn great. Thank you my friends for being with me for all these years supporting me, encouraging me, you mean more to me than you can even imagine."
Santa_Ono_141.wav, Let's hear it for the University of Chicago students.
Santa_Ono_142.wav," Let me, I cannot resist being on camera to say that meat house beat Chamberlain in football."
Santa_Ono_143.wav," Inside Joe Guy. As we open this new chapter in the history of University of Michigan, let us begin."
Santa_Ono_144.wav, by looking back to our beginnings. The Northwest ordinance of 1787 declared in the words inscribed on the parapet of the
Santa_Ono_145.wav," above the beautiful angel hall. Religion, morality and knowledge are necessary to good government and the"
Santa_Ono_146.wav," happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged."
Santa_Ono_147.wav," That document led to our founding in 1817 by Judge Augustus Woodward, Father Gabriel Rechard and Reverend John Monties."
Santa_Ono_148.wav, And as our campus grew and evolved our ethos became one of providing an uncommon education for the common person.
Santa_Ono_149.wav," In our aspiration of elevating society by lifting the distinct ineffable potential of each individual, no matter their background,"
Santa_Ono_150.wav," color or creed to be certain. We have had our short foldings as an institution, as all have."
Santa_Ono_151.wav, and we will face them honestly always walking with respect and humility. Let us remember
Santa_Ono_152.wav," It was on this stage behind this lectern, then Martin Luther King spoke in 1962 before giving his"
Santa_Ono_153.wav, I have a dream speech. That's a piece of history that commits us to continuing that work moving forward.
Santa_Ono_154.wav," forward. Today, let us be united around that same mission and purpose, the same commitment to inclusion and excellence"
Santa_Ono_155.wav, discovery and integrity. Today we have exceptional programs in science and engineering
Santa_Ono_156.wav," law, medicine, business, and the arts, the social sciences and the humanities. And let me say,"
Santa_Ono_157.wav," say, as I've said, from the corner of this continent to the other side, the liberal arts are crucially important for the development of critical"
Santa_Ono_158.wav, thinking they are more important today than ever before. Don't you agree?
Santa_Ono_159.wav," Today we are proudly, proudly a public university."
Santa_Ono_160.wav," Still aspiring to be welcoming to all inclusive of all, exceptional for all, and come an honor."
Santa_Ono_161.wav, on common education for the common person. Now there are challenges that we face. Today I submit
Santa_Ono_162.wav," that the world needs the University of Michigan more than ever before. For everywhere we look, we see a world in distress with tensions"
Santa_Ono_163.wav," rising and conflicts raging. A broad, we face a fundamental challenge between democracies and autocracies, even"
Santa_Ono_164.wav," as the bloody hands of tyrants are set against innocence, aspiring to basic rights and dignities. At home we see a child"
Santa_Ono_165.wav, between pluralism and celibacy. Between the shrill cry of political tribalism and partisanship.
Santa_Ono_166.wav, quiet call of civic engagement and citizenship. Even today we are wrestling with racism and inequality.
Santa_Ono_167.wav," and injustice, and as heirs to the unfinished work of Martin Luther King Jr., we cannot, we will not falter."
Santa_Ono_168.wav, in that task and responsibility. We're all also grappling with the long-term impacts of the COVID crisis.
Santa_Ono_169.wav," Even as we prepare for the next pandemic, above all, we must address the climate emergency."
Santa_Ono_170.wav, Our planet is growing warmer and warmer. Our natural environment is deteriorating and none of us is immune from its death.
Santa_Ono_171.wav, devastating impacts. The climate crisis is the existential challenge of our time.
Santa_Ono_172.wav, We know that the world is searching for solutions.
Santa_Ono_173.wav," And I can tell you, I already have engaged with the deans and many leaders of institutes of this institution and they have come back to me yesterday."
Santa_Ono_174.wav, with an exciting and bold vision of how the world can look to the University of Michigan to confront this existential challenge.
Santa_Ono_175.wav, Thank you for your leadership to the deans and heads and directors of this universe. Let's hear it for them. Applause
Santa_Ono_176.wav, Challenges notwithstanding. Let's remember that we are here to find solutions.
Santa_Ono_177.wav, for it was here on the steps of the Michigan Union that the Senator John F. Kennedy gave the speech that inspired him.
Santa_Ono_178.wav," the world and launched the Peace Corps. Since then, nearly 3,000 universities of Michigan alumni have volunteered to change lives around the world."
Santa_Ono_179.wav," around the world through public service. Today through our Ford School, we are showing that collaboration and partnership are a better solution."
Santa_Ono_180.wav," to give just one example. Luke Schaefer, the school's associate dean for academic affairs, had a"
Santa_Ono_181.wav," critical role in the expansion of the child tax credit in 2021, which is received support from both sides of the aisle and has been hailed as"
Santa_Ono_182.wav, one of the most successful anti-poverty measures ever signed into law. Thanks to its multifaceted expertise.
Santa_Ono_183.wav," impact and policy reach. The Ford School, named after Gerald Ford, remains a leader in domestic and"
Santa_Ono_184.wav, international policy education and a leading hub for engagement with the foreign policy community. Yet as we look to salute
Santa_Ono_185.wav," solutions abroad, we must acknowledge that we still have challenges at home. Racism is one of America's original sins."
Santa_Ono_186.wav, And the University of Michigan has not been immune from participating in racism. We have excluded and segregated
Santa_Ono_187.wav," because of their race or gender, ethnicity, religious faith, or sexual orientation."
Santa_Ono_188.wav, doing so if you think about it. We have robbed those individuals and our university and our world of their incredible talent and potential.
Santa_Ono_189.wav, potential. We must not do it again. Our nation is searching for a better way to deliver on the promises of justice
Santa_Ono_190.wav, inclusion and diversity. So let us join hands together here at the University of Michigan. And let us remember that previous University of Michigan
Santa_Ono_191.wav," the Michigan Presidents, like Lee Bolanger, Jim Deuterstadt, and Mary Sue Coleman set an example by going to the Supreme Court"
Santa_Ono_192.wav, to defend admissions policies intended to achieve a more diverse student body. We salute them. Let's give them a round of applause.
Santa_Ono_193.wav, made it for us.
Santa_Ono_194.wav," And we will not waver as an institution. We've embarked on an inclusive history project, which is being led by professors Elizabeth"
Santa_Ono_195.wav," all and Earl Lewis. This process of self discovery will sometimes be difficult, painful, but it is cruel."
Santa_Ono_196.wav," for acknowledging our past and truthful way with clear eyes in plain sight, we can better move forward together with the"
Santa_Ono_197.wav," a firm step for true equity and inclusion. In January, we released the results of our DEI 1.0 initiative, which made"
Santa_Ono_198.wav," clear that while we have made progress and we have, that we still have much more to do. So, as we look to D.I."
Santa_Ono_199.wav," 2.0 let us strive to nurture, thoughtful, and understanding citizens, and further establish campuses and communities where each individual"
Santa_Ono_200.wav," The visual can live in peace and safety, and can learn and grow and thrive, and in turn give back to their families, their neighbors."
Santa_Ono_201.wav," neighborhoods, the nation and the world. As we do so, we must also address the current and future threat of pandemic."
Santa_Ono_202.wav, across history they have shaken societies and destroyed untold lives. We have seen it happen in front of our own eyes.
Santa_Ono_203.wav," of the past several years. Yet here too, the University of Michigan has an almost unparalleled track record"
Santa_Ono_204.wav," to provide solutions. In early 1940s, two outstanding University of Michigan public health physicians"
Santa_Ono_205.wav," Thomas Francis Jr. and his young mentee, Jonas Salk, isolated some of the first strains of influenza."
Santa_Ono_206.wav," and developed the first flu vaccine. Several years later, Salk developed a vaccine against the dreaded polio virus and frail"
Santa_Ono_207.wav, Francis here at the University of Michigan led the clinical trials that proved that the vaccine was self-safe and effective.
Santa_Ono_208.wav," Within a decade of their announcement in 1955, Polio was eliminated from this country, and eventually most of the world."
Santa_Ono_209.wav, That is the reach. That is the impact of this great institution. And we can do it again. Against the unremitting rise of
Santa_Ono_210.wav," new diseases, we continue as faculty and students to discover, innovate, explore, adapt, and heal those who are."
Santa_Ono_211.wav," are sick. In 1999, we established, under leadership of Mary Su Coleman, the Life Sciences Institute."
Santa_Ono_212.wav, which was designed to foster interdisciplinary research and creative risk taking and strengthen the connections across our world class.
Santa_Ono_213.wav, life sciences community and other sciences that could strengthen and synergize with that expertise to provide the solutions that we
Santa_Ono_214.wav, need so capably led now by Dr. Roger Cohn. And through our biosciences initiative we are
Santa_Ono_215.wav, building today on University of Michigan strengths in the areas of biosciences that will have a global impact. Today our staff
Santa_Ono_216.wav, at Michigan Medicine. Continues to serve patients and their loved ones with relentless compassion and excellence. As we
Santa_Ono_217.wav, We attend to the physical health of our community. We must also support their full wellness as individuals.
Santa_Ono_218.wav," The students that we love, Generation Z, is facing a wave of anxiety and depression disorders."
Santa_Ono_219.wav," partially because of the pandemic. It's a challenge or students, staff, and faculty face every day."
Santa_Ono_220.wav, I understand. That's why I'm so pleased that the University of Michigan was one of the first American schools to adopt
Santa_Ono_221.wav," the Okanagan Charter, which commits us as an institution to promoting the health and well-being of each person across our three campuses."
Santa_Ono_222.wav," We've also established the well-being collective, which takes a holistic approach to the development and wellness of the whole world."
Santa_Ono_223.wav, person and in turn the whole community. Student health and wellbeing will be
Santa_Ono_224.wav, is one of my highest priorities as president of the University of Michigan.
Santa_Ono_225.wav, So let us walk together towards wellness and wholeness and
Santa_Ono_226.wav," at Michigan. Finally, we must address that most vexing exercise"
Santa_Ono_227.wav," the time, the climate emergency. Here as well, University of Michigan has long been"
Santa_Ono_228.wav," in the lead and his poise to lead even further. In 1881, we became the first US University to offer classes in forestry."
Santa_Ono_229.wav, And we know that understanding the impact of climate change on forests and the importance of biodiversity in being one powerful force in mitigating climate change.
Santa_Ono_230.wav, change is going to be important. Over time it became our school of environment and sustainability which today is a leader in environmental education.
Santa_Ono_231.wav, research and action across the institution we have over 750 faculty focused on the climate emergency. We are building
Santa_Ono_232.wav," building and initiatives to spur multidisciplinary innovations towards climate action, like the Graham Sustainability Institute, the Institute for Energy Solutions."
Santa_Ono_233.wav," M.I. Hydrogen and the Carbon Neutrality Acceleration Program. As we work towards carbon neutrality on all three campuses,"
Santa_Ono_234.wav, of our approaches to electricity from renewable sources by 2025.
Santa_Ono_235.wav, 5 and we will eliminate all of our greenhouse gas emissions from direct campus sources by 2040. This is an emergency
Santa_Ono_236.wav, and we will step up our efforts. Thank you. The umh ha-ha-ha.
Santa_Ono_237.wav, and we will continue to incorporate carbon neutrality into our new building projects and by engaging with communities to ensure that our strategies are just as
Santa_Ono_238.wav, equitable. We are seeking extensive on-campus solar power installations when we are the largest of any institution in the United States and collaborating
Santa_Ono_239.wav," closely in this effort with the city of Ann Arbor, and we are grateful to have a great mayor of Ann Arbor."
Santa_Ono_240.wav," Today we are in the midst of a national surge for a sustainable,"
Santa_Ono_241.wav," leader. And we're developing a university wide structure designed to elevate and unite sustainability scholarship, teaching and community engagement."
Santa_Ono_242.wav, Because all of that will be necessary for us to solve this existential challenge. Our world is facing the fiery challenge of
Santa_Ono_243.wav," our time, as well as others ranging from aging populations to the ongoing rise of increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence."
Santa_Ono_244.wav," Together, let us find solutions to these challenges, just like the University of Michigan has done for centuries."
Santa_Ono_245.wav," Let us transform our excellence into action and impact. And let us create a brighter, stronger, and more vibrant,"
Santa_Ono_246.wav," University, one dedicated to egalitarian excellence in service to humanity and better prepared and positioned"
Santa_Ono_247.wav, to educate tomorrow's leaders who are our students today. I trust
Santa_Ono_248.wav," that each student who graduates from this exceptional university, whether this year or ten years hence, 25 years from now."
Santa_Ono_249.wav," Now, I hope that they will have a deep sense of gratitude for the education that they have received, as well as a profound understanding of the education they have received."
Santa_Ono_250.wav, understanding of the responsibility that comes with that education and a lifelong commitment to leverage their learning to make a difference in society.
Santa_Ono_251.wav, society and in service to others. Let us make that the resonant debt of University of Michigan.
Santa_Ono_252.wav, So let us build.
Santa_Ono_253.wav, that university together. For at University of Michigan we have an unparalleled capacity to connect.
Santa_Ono_254.wav," And we must connect now as never before. We have world-leading experts, exceptional graduates,"
Santa_Ono_255.wav," programs, incredible strengths in interdisciplinary studies. We also have an outstanding diversity of talented students."
Santa_Ono_256.wav, Each with unique perspectives and talents and the high confidence that we can change the world.
Santa_Ono_257.wav, I have no doubt we can and we will if we do so together by building bridges.
Santa_Ono_258.wav," I aspire to see us become even more interdisciplinary, even more interconnected than we are."
Santa_Ono_259.wav," I can tell you and speaking to the deans and hedged directors, they share that passion and that goal. Today we have an impact on the world."
Santa_Ono_260.wav," incredible range of multidisciplinary efforts and programs, ranging from our recently announced arts initiative to our Center for RNA Biomedicine."
Santa_Ono_261.wav," to our space institute. But we can build on those efforts, connecting in new ways across academic boundaries and open"
Santa_Ono_262.wav," new horizons. We must also come closer together across our campuses, strengthening the bonds between the two sides."
Santa_Ono_263.wav," between Flint, Dearborn, and Ann Arbor, and building deeper connections to centers across our state, such as the Sparrow Health System."
Santa_Ono_264.wav," in Lansing and the University of Michigan Center for Innovation in Detroit, where we will break ground this year."
Santa_Ono_265.wav, As we come closer together as a university.
Santa_Ono_266.wav," We must also come together as a state, a nation, and a global community. We heard from Jenny,"
Santa_Ono_267.wav, in the Poletano earlier today. Our leadership now of the University Climate Change Coalition are part of the
Santa_Ono_268.wav," partnerships with the AAU universities, the U7 plus the Lions of World Universities and others, to say nothing of our research engagement"
Santa_Ono_269.wav," with a vast range of federal agencies, these are all essentials. Yet we can do so much more to you."
Santa_Ono_270.wav," together. For that reason, we have embarked on a strategic visioning process. One designed to sharpen our impact and determine"
Santa_Ono_271.wav," who we are as a university, what we stand for, where we want to go, where we want to play, and what we want to do."
Santa_Ono_272.wav," we aspire to achieve as a great public university. Over this next several months, our entire university community"
Santa_Ono_273.wav," will engage, is already engaging in a collective process to imagine our future and chart our course ahead."
Santa_Ono_274.wav," This vision will be about what we can do, what we aspire to do together. As I said, it's so crucial that we do"
Santa_Ono_275.wav," so now. If we look at history, universities typically evolve and change gradually. It is"
Santa_Ono_276.wav," often a deliberate considered pace that universities add new infrastructure, higher new staff and faculty."
Santa_Ono_277.wav," But if you look at that history as is described very eloquently in President Deuter-Stats book at the helm, universities may also"
Santa_Ono_278.wav, go through periods of sudden rapid change through a punctuated equilibrium that opens new horizons and sets them on a decisive new
Santa_Ono_279.wav," trajectory. To give a few examples, if you look back to 1854, President Henry Tappen,"
Santa_Ono_280.wav," had a vision of creating here at the University of Michigan, one of the first true American research universities."
Santa_Ono_281.wav," That vision was followed with decisive action. The installation of the third largest refracting telescope in the world, I was now called"
Santa_Ono_282.wav," the Detroit Observatory, now surrounded by medical buildings of Michigan medicine. And the recruitment at that time of University of Michigan's first PhD faculty"
Santa_Ono_283.wav," faculty member Franz Brunov to use it for research and education. It was a bold vision, a bold recruitment, and a bold environment."
Santa_Ono_284.wav, investment in new facilities. Astronomers used that telescope to make numerous discoveries and establish the University of Michigan as a leading
Santa_Ono_285.wav," research university not just in that field, but in attracted serious scholars in many other disciplines. It drew other"
Santa_Ono_286.wav, outstanding researchers even as many of our students went on to become among astronomy's leading lights.
Santa_Ono_287.wav, President James Angel then framed the University of Michigan as an institution as a champion
Santa_Ono_288.wav," freedom committed to inclusiveness and dedicated to the service of democracy. President Marion Burton, I'm"
Santa_Ono_289.wav," after whom the Burton Tower just outside is named, then transformed our central campus with the first campus plan. And years later,"
Santa_Ono_290.wav," President Harold Shapiro, also a McGill graduate, developed a strategic vision which reaminated"
Santa_Ono_291.wav, our pursuit of excellence. His work of renewal and revitalization was continued in strength and when he hired none other
Santa_Ono_292.wav, than James Studor's staff. Provost at the time and Dean of Engineering and developed a vision focused on three elements.
Santa_Ono_293.wav, globalization and pluralism. Further shaping the campus we know today and moving to what we now know as North Campus.
Santa_Ono_294.wav," Friends, I say today it is time for a new vision, a new punctuation, a new opening of possibilities"
Santa_Ono_295.wav," for the University of Michigan. It is a time to dare great challenges and to dream bold dreams. And as we envision, imagine and aspire"
Santa_Ono_296.wav," We will also build. Concurrently with our strategic visioning process, we will develop a long-term campus plan to fulfill"
Santa_Ono_297.wav," that vision and to ensure that we establish the living, working, and learning environments needed for our staff, students, and faculty in the"
Santa_Ono_298.wav," days and decades to come. I encourage you, all of you, whether you're here or watching online, to participate."
Santa_Ono_299.wav," in creating this vision of ours together. Who we are, what we stand for, and where we are going as a great"
Santa_Ono_300.wav," public university. In conclusion, they'll go find it."
Santa_Ono_301.wav," I am convinced, if you couldn't notice, that the brightest days for the University of Michigan"
Santa_Ono_302.wav," and lie ahead. And I'm certain that by constantly discovering, learning, connecting, aspiring,"
Santa_Ono_303.wav, we can transform our world just as we have for 200 years. This is our time to renew the
Santa_Ono_304.wav," this rise, this commitment, this is our moment to dream, bold dreams. So let us begin today and continue that process. Let us set free"
Santa_Ono_305.wav, are full power and potential as one of the world's great universities. Let us come together like never before to address the world's most pressing challenges.
Santa_Ono_306.wav, challenges. Live our best traditions at the University and create a future beyond our dreams. Together we can.
Santa_Ono_307.wav, Thank you and go blue.
Santa_Ono_308.wav, Thank you.
Santa_Ono_309.wav, Thank you.
Santa_Ono_310.wav, Thank you.
Santa_Ono_311.wav, I forgot something.
Santa_Ono_312.wav," Ready? Guys, ready? By the way, I want to say something. In this wonderful inaugural cello ensemble. Let's hear it for then, by the way."
Santa_Ono_313.wav, There is one special person who revived my ability to play Giacello from near death.
Santa_Ono_314.wav," And that is a professor of cello at CCM at the University of Cincinnati and a member of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra. Ladies and gentlemen, please let me know."
Santa_Ono_315.wav," here for Alan Raffer, Alan please stand. Alan. And once again,"
Santa_Ono_316.wav," Again, thank you to the inaugural cello ensemble. You've been fantastic and also to the singer. And I hope I don't mess it up."
Santa_Ono_317.wav," Hello, colleagues and friends across the University of Michigan community. It's finally summer, a season of relaxation, vacation, and personal renewal."
Santa_Ono_318.wav," Yet research never rests. It is a constant process of discovery and inspiration, insight and imagination, innovation and"
Santa_Ono_319.wav," and invention. Even during these summer months, our research continues to have a profound impact in our community, our state, and our nation."
Santa_Ono_320.wav," To give just a couple of examples, UM is one of the largest employers in Michigan. In this past fiscal year, our research enterprise contributed a whole lot of work."
Santa_Ono_321.wav," 126 million to the state's economy directly through the purchase of goods and services. In fact, over the past five years."
Santa_Ono_322.wav, We've contributed more than half a billion dollars to Michigan-based companies supplying goods and services in support of our research projects.
Santa_Ono_323.wav," That's just the beginning. Just a few weeks ago, we announced that we are investing 55 million to launch a"
Santa_Ono_324.wav," a multidisciplinary, quantum research institute, which will expand our work in this burgeoning field, as well as better prepare students for leading"
Santa_Ono_325.wav," roles in the future quantum workforce. We also engage with state, private sector and educational partners in the semiconductor."
Santa_Ono_326.wav," and Dr. Talent Action Team, a new effort to make Michigan a leader in the semiconductor industry. Hand in hand with that effort."
Santa_Ono_327.wav," We have joined a partnership to establish a semiconductor talent and automotive initiative in Michigan, which will focus on the accelerating research"
Santa_Ono_328.wav," in electric and autonomous vehicles, as well as talent acquisition, training and development. Thanks to the State of Michigan, we"
Santa_Ono_329.wav, We will be building a $130 million electric vehicle center which will be focused on technology and workforce development and solidify
Santa_Ono_330.wav, our state and our nation as a leader in the industry. And we will be using a nearly $10 million federal grant.
Santa_Ono_331.wav, to assist in efforts to deploy solar to everything technology. A technology that will enable a new generation of cars.
Santa_Ono_332.wav, to exchange safety-inhousing data with the world around them. I'm especially excited about the possibilities of UM's innovative
Santa_Ono_333.wav, partnership's office. Innovation partnerships was established to serve as the primary gateway for researchers seeking to increase the impact of
Santa_Ono_334.wav," of their work through commercialization. So far, this fiscal year, the office has supported a launch of 21 startup companies."
Santa_Ono_335.wav," and has received more than 550 new invention discoveries from UM faculty, which places us among the top"
Santa_Ono_336.wav, universities in the nation. And last year our startups generated more than three-quarters of a billion dollars in investment activity.
Santa_Ono_337.wav," The office is led by Kelly Sexton, Associate Vice President for Research and Innovation Partnerships who is this month's portrait"
Santa_Ono_338.wav," of a Wolverine. But rather than me talking about her, it's better for her to tell you a bit more about herself."
Santa_Ono_339.wav, What inspires and excites her about the office and what possibilities she sees ahead. Let me leave you with one final thought.
Santa_Ono_340.wav," We've discussed a lot of numbers, but the true value of our R&D goes far beyond that."
Santa_Ono_341.wav, It's about more than creating new knowledge or developing new products important as they are. It's about opening opportunities.
Santa_Ono_342.wav," colleagues and friends across the UM community. Shortly after starting my dream job, President of this exceptional university, I asked us to engage in a strategic vision across the world."
